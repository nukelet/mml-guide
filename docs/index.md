# pedipanol's guide to MML

Hello! And welcome to my MML Guide!

This is a project with the goal of documenting MML in english with the goal of not only providing a basic understanding of the general format, as well as diving deep into individual formats being more clear about practical use scenarios compared to rigid command documentation.

I hope this will help you in whatever your goal is, or at least that it serves as a good read into old chiptune tools.
