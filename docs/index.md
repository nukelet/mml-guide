# pedipanol's guide to MML

Hello! And welcome to my MML Guide!

This is a project with the goal of documenting MML in english with the goal of not only providing a basic understanding of the general format, as well as diving deep into individual formats being more clear about practical use scenarios compared to rigid command documentation.

I hope this will help you in whatever your goal is, or at least that it serves as a good read into old chiptune tools.

If you encounter any problems or have anything to say or ask about this guide, you can message me on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pedipanol) or send me an ask on [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/pedipanol)
