# General MML

While MML formats can't be 100% compatible with each other, as they derive from the same basis and from each other, there the core of it is common among most of them. This section of the guide aims to explain the core of it, so it can serve as a basis for any format you decide to get into, or that it can help you at least get some gist of any MML script you try to read or interpret.
