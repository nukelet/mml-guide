# General MML

While MML formats can't be 100% compatible with each other, as they derive from the same basis and from each other, there the core of it is common among most of them.

This section is will teach you general information that (at least in concept) will apply to 90% of the MML formats out there, so even though each format will diverge in its own, this guide at the very least will help you get the gist of it to the point you can figure out the specifics on your own.
