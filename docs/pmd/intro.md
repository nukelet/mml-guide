# Professional Music Driver (PMD)

PMD is a driver used for making music for the PC-98, PC-88, X68000, FM Towns and IBM PC families. Being a consumer-grade driver allowed it to be used for many games, becoming one of the most popular drivers at the time, along with FMP. Notable examples of games using it are Touhou Project and Grounseed.

Developed by [Masahiro Kajihara](https://twitter.com/kajaponn) in 1989, PMD was developed and improved as he made his carreer programming and writing music for games, including its ports to different platforms. Development stopped around the year 2000 with the transition to modern computers, but in 2019, for the celebration of its 30th anniversary, KAJA not only updated it with support for new commands, but also released its [source code](https://sites.google.com/site/kajapon/pmd) to the public.

With its latter updates being mostly focused on PC-98 music, there are features explained in this guide that the other versions might not support, so this guide is focused on that platform.

_I'm planning on making an addendum explaining usage and differences for PMDIBM which I've used before; maybe others will come in the future as well._
