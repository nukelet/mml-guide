## 86 Soundboard Panning

The only command worth explaining on this page is regarding the 86 soundboard that has an additional panning command. For more on the PCM channels, check the explaning PCM page on this guide.

The 86 soundboard being software generated and stereo allows the PMD drivers that use it ( PMD86 and PPZ8 ) to use full panning as opposed to the hardpanning of the OPNA.

The original p\<value> command can be used with them

### PPZ Channel panning (px\<value>)
